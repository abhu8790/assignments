Volumes can be declared in two different ways.

Within a Dockerfile, with a VOLUME instruction.
VOLUME /uploads
On the command-line, with the -v flag for docker run.
$ docker run -d -v /uploads myapp
In both cases, /uploads (inside the container) will be a volume.

Create a file with name volume and paste the following content to it:

FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN mkdir /data
WORKDIR /data
RUN echo "Hello from Volume" > test
VOLUME /data
